TypeScript Todo App


 This repository contains a simple Todo application built using TypeScript.
 It serves as my first step in learning TypeScript, focusing on understanding its syntax, type annotations, and how it enhances JavaScript development.

Features:

Add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
Type-safe code with explicit types for better code quality.
Basic usage of interfaces, classes, and modules in TypeScript.



This project helped me get hands-on experience with TypeScript fundamentals while creating a practical and interactive application. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for learning TypeScript.
